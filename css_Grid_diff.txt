CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are both layout models in CSS, but they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

   ****         CSS Flexbox:

Use Case: Primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either as a row or a column.

Direction: Flexbox is best suited for laying out items in a single direction, either horizontally or vertically.

Child Elements: It works well when you want to distribute space along a single axis among a group of items. It's excellent for building navigation bars, lists, and other similar structures.

    ***       CSS Grid:

Use Case: Designed for two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns.
Grid Structure: Allows you to create a grid-based layout with both rows and columns, providing more control over the placement of items in both directions.
Complex Layouts: Ideal for building complex layouts where items need to be positioned across both rows and columns. Its great for designing overall page structure.
Choosing between Flexbox and Grid:

Flexbox: Choose Flexbox when dealing with a single-dimensional layout, like items in a navigation bar or a list of items. If you need flexibility in the order of items or want to distribute space along a single axis, Flexbox is a good choice.

Grid: Choose Grid when working with a two-dimensional layout, such as a page with a header, footer, and multiple sections. If you need precise control over the placement of items in both rows and columns, Grid is the better option.
